# Tasks to finish before release
Note: the game isn't supposed to be extremely polished, since it's basically a
tech demo. So this list isn't about making the game perfect, just shippable.
- Intro screen where the game can be started, closed, and the fov can be configured
- Some kind of a fence mesh at the end so it isn't just an invisible wall
- FIXMEs
