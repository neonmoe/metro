# Tasks to finish before release
Note: the game isn't supposed to be extremely polished, since it's basically a
tech demo. So this list isn't about making the game perfect, just shippable.
- Intro screen where the game can be started, closed, and the volume/fov can be
  configured
- Some kind of a fence mesh at the end so it isn't just an invisible wall
- Ominous metro sounds / windy tunnel sounds now and then
- The footstep sound could be recut to be a bit more consistent in
  time-to-impact
- Also, maybe add echo instead of just the reverb? The footsteps don't sound
  spacey enough yet.
- FIXMEs
