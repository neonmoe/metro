     "but the original plans were a bit more ambitious.",
     "There was a plan for 108 stations, built a lot closer to the surface.",
     "", "On the bright side, the current system is a lot simpler to use.", ""},

     "The metro is quite deep in the ground, feels like going into a bunker.",

     "", "The station is very deep. So the escalator is very long.", ""},
    {"You should be seeing some black dots on the walls by now.", "",
     "Those appear because the numbers I use to represent",

     "When programming computer graphics, we use so-called",

     "but struggle with with accuracy sometimes."},
    {"I find the noise in this metro tunnel quite interesting.", "",

     "The patterns demonstrate how floating-point numbers have",
     "less accurate 'areas' of numbers. Or, in this case, actual areas."},
    {"Another interesting part about the noise, is that it",

     "This whole tunnel is based on the same ~10m long template, repeated.",
