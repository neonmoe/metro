# untitled
This unnamed project is a walking simulator. The environment is the
Ruoholahti-Lauttasaari part of the Helsinki metro, with the interiors
being completely improvised, but the route based on [some plans found
on the internet (page 41)][metro-plan].

The game takes about 25 minutes to walk through completely.

### Controls
- WASD or IJKL to move
- Arrow keys or mouse to look around

#### Configuration keys
- B to toggle head bobbing animation
- T to toggle the font (between VT323, which fits the game better
  aesthetically, and Open Sans, which is easier to read)

### Building
Just run the script relevant to your operating system. If it doesn't
work, refer to the documentation of
[raylib-template](https://git.neon.moe/neon/raylib-template).
